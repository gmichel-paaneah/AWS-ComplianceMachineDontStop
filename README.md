# AWS Compliance Machine Don't Stop!
#### Proof of Value Terraform Scripts to utilize Amazon Web Services (AWS) Security, Identity & Compliance Services to Support your AWS Account Security Posture. 
These Terraform Scripts are made with using the Preview of AWS Security Hub in Mind. Security Hub collects Information from GuardDuty, Macie, Inspector as well as AWS Config. Security Hub (the Preview at least) comes with Center for Internet Security (CIS) Config Rules that follow best security practices for account-wide security posture. The Services that are turned on, as well as the inline CloudFormation Stack are all made to support these CIS Rules from Security Hub, and also go a good way towards general security hardening for your account. Visualization & Alerting support have also been added (please refer to ReadMe & Changelog) via Kinesis and Glue to perform crawling & ETL of logs from AWS WAF. Services that are used are listed later in the Readme, this is also a work in progress and other features may be added such as Amazon Macie, and Custom Lambda Functions / CloudWatch Events to further Support Security Posture on AWS.

## Getting Started

### Baseline Knowledge Required
- Basic Level Understanding of navigating AWS Console, usage of SSH (or however you use Terraform) and Linux text editors (Vi, Vim, Nano, etc)

### Prerequisites:
**Below Steps are Done on a Fresh Install of Ubuntu 18.04LTS**
**Refer to (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html) for Information on how to Install the SSM Agent on Non-Amazon Linux / Ubuntu Distros**
1. Update Your System
`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
2. Download Latest Version of Inspector Agent (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_installing-uninstalling-agents.html)
`wget https://inspector-agent.amazonaws.com/linux/latest/install`
3. Install Inspector Agent
`sudo bash install`
4. Install Unzip
`sudo apt-get install unzip`
5. Grab the Latest Version of Terraform (https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
`wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.11.13/terraform_0.11.13_linux_amd64.zip`
6. Unzip Terraform Installation
`unzip terraform_0.11.13_linux_amd64.zip`
7. Move to /local/bin - or you can add Terraform to your PATH
`sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/`
8. Ensure that Terraform is Installed Correctly
`terraform --version`
9. Ensure your EC2 Instances have an Instance Profile that allows full access to SSM Attached to them (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-configuring-access-role.html)

### Installing & Configuration
1. Create & Navigate to a New Directory
`mkdir aws-cmds && cd aws-cmds`
2. Clone this Repo
`git clone https://github.com/jonrau1/AWS-ComplianceMachineDontStop.git`
3. Add your Region to the *provider.tf* 
`nano provider.tf`
4. Enter your AWS Secret Key & AWS Access Key into *terraform.tfvars*
`nano terraform.tfvars`
5. Fill out the *variables.tf* file
`nano variables.tf`
6. Ensure proper elements for your Region from *variables.tf* are Referenced in *data.tf*
`nano data.tf`
7. (Only if Using WAF) navigate to WAF Sub-Directory
`cd AWS WAF`
8. (Only if Using WAF) repeat steps 3-5 & modify Rules & IPs based on reccomendations from https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/aws-waf-owasp.pdf
`nano waf.tf`
9. (Only if using VPC Module) fill out Variables -- make sure to specify Region as it is used by VPC Endpoints (PrivateLink)
`cd VPC Module` && `nano variables.tf`
#### !! Notes on `Variables.tf` !!
- There is a List Variable for Amazon Inspector ARNs for the Rules Packages within for US-EAST-1 and US-WEST-1 Regions, you will need to modify that whole list for regions outside of US-EAST-1/US-WEST-1 and modify the correct variable reference within `main.tf`
- You will also need to modify `data.tf` to use the populated `InspectorRemediationSNSTopicPolicyData_*` Variable for your Region within the Resource Element: `data "aws_iam_policy_document" "Inspector_Remediation_SNS_Topic_Policy_Data"`
- Ensure that the `PathToInspectorRemediationLambdaUpload` within `variables.tf` uses just the folder path, and does not refer to the ZIP File -- i.e. `default = "~/aws-cmds/functions/"`

### Deploying
1. Initialize your AWS Provider
`terraform init`
2. Create a Plan
`terraform plan`
3. Apply the Plan
`terraform apply`
4. Deploy
`yes`
5. Navigate to AWS Config Console & Finish Setup
    - Ensure you use your Created Role & Not the Service Linked Role
    - Navigate to Settings and then click Save for additional resources to be added into IAM Role Policy
6. Attach Remediation SNS Topic to your Inspector Assessment Target Group (Terraform does not yet support this)
    - Navigate to Inspector > Assessment Templates > <Your Assessment Template> > Manage SNS Topics > Select Your Remediation SNS Topic
    - Remove All Events *except* for `Findings Reported` & Save
7. Navigate to AWS Glue Console and Edit your Crawlers, go into the `Output` section > `Configuration Options` and check the box that says "Update all new and existing partitions with metadata from the table"
8. Ensure you CIS Compliance SNS Topic has a Subscriber that is confirmed (Email, SMS, etc) to ensure CIS Compliance checks for Metrics & Alarms Pass

### Out of Scope
- Macie -- Terraform currently does not support Activating Macie, only subscribing Buckets to Scan to Macie
